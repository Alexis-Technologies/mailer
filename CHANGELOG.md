## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Package scaffold** set up like the other Alexis libraries: plain CommonJS with no build step,
  a hand-written `index.d.ts`, a closed `exports` map, Node.js 22 or newer, and zero runtime
  dependencies.
- **`createMailer` placeholder.** It throws until the mailer is implemented; its signature is
  provisional.
- **Tooling:** pnpm, oxlint and oxfmt, `node:test` suites with c8 coverage gates, tsd type tests,
  an export-parity check between the runtime and `index.d.ts`, a check that `src/` requires only
  Node builtins, bundle tests through esbuild, a bundle-size budget (`pnpm size`) and a
  zero-dependency benchmark harness (`pnpm bench`).
- **CI** on GitHub Actions and a VitePress documentation site at
  [mailer.vercel.app](https://mailer.vercel.app/), with a comparison of 14 Node.js email libraries
  generated from `docs/comparison.json`.
